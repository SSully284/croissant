    A croissant is crescent shaped roll made with yeast-risen dough.
    <br />
    <br />

    The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in a process called lamination.
    <br />

    The
    final dough is cut into triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a layered,
    flaky
    textured roll, more like puff pastry.
    <br />
    <br />

    The main ingredients in a croissant are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and butter.
    <br />
    <br />

    A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. It should be
    evenly
    baked and well aerated.
    <br />

  fresh, on the day of baking.
